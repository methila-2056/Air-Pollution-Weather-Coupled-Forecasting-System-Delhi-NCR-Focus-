/**
* Write `public/demo-credentials.json` at build time so the login page can show
 * the demo account without waiting on the backend.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The demo credential used to be fetched from `GET /api/auth/demo`, which only
 * answers once the FastAPI container is serving. On Render's free tier that
 * instance sleeps after ~15 min idle and takes 45-120 s to wake, and the
 * `keepalive` workflow meant to hold it awake declares a 5-minute cron but
 * actually runs on a median 260 min cadence (60 runs measured; zero failures, so
 * it is GitHub throttling the cron rather than the job breaking). Measured
 * against production: 83,397 ms for the first request, 435 ms once warm. The demo
 * affordance was therefore invisible on the login page for well over a minute,
 * and nothing in the frontend could fix it -- the credential only existed
 * behind the booting container.
 *
 * Vercel serves the built bundle from its own CDN, so reading the credential
 * from a static file costs a same-origin request in milliseconds regardless of
 * whether Render is awake.
 *
 * Security posture
 * ----------------
 * This does not make the credential secret that it was not already. It is
 * published in `render.yaml` in this public repository, and any visitor could
 * read it by waiting out the cold start. What it does change is that the value
 * ships in the built frontend, so it is only written when the build is
 * explicitly configured for it:
 *
 *   ENABLE_DEMO_USER=true        opt in; anything else (including unset) writes
 *                                `{"enabled": false}`, matching the backend where
 *                                `enable_demo_user` unset means "off in
 *                                production"
 *   DEMO_USER_PASSWORD          required when enabled
 *   DEMO_USER_EMAIL              defaults to the backend's own default
 *   DEMO_USER_NAME / _ROLE       optional, default to the backend's defaults
 *
 * `/api/auth/demo` remains authoritative: the frontend only uses this file as a
 * fast path and still falls back to the endpoint when the file carries no
 * credential, so turning the demo off on the backend still hides the affordance.
 *
 * The output file is git-ignored; it is a build artifact, never a tracked one.
