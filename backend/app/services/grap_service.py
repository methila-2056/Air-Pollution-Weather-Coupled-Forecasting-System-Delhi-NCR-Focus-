"""Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for Delhi NCR.

Implements the standardised stage matrix notified by the Commission for Air
Quality Management (CAQM) for the National Capital Region.  Indexing is by the
24-hour average AQI (the same values used across the forecasting pipeline):

    Stage I    201-300   Poor        (pre-emptive, year-round actions)
    Stage II   301-400   Very Poor   (Severe-level abatement)
    Stage III  401-450   Severe      (construction/petrol-diesel curbs)
    Stage IV   451+      Severe+     (emergency curbs: odd-even, school closure)

Thresholds follow the October-2024 CAQM revision (Stage III spans 401-450 and
Stage IV begins above 450, splitting the old single >400 severe band).

This module is deliberately pure / dependency-free so it can be unit-tested in
isolation and reused by the API layer.
