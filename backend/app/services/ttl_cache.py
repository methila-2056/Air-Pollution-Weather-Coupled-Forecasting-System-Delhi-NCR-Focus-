"""Tiny thread-safe TTL cache for expensive control-room aggregations.

The Render free tier talks to a pooled Neon Postgres that can take 10-30s to
answer the heavy count/aggregation queries powering the Control Room
(``/api/data-quality``, ``/api/atmosphere/current``, ``/api/transport-risk/current``,
``/api/summary``). Those results are recomputed on every request, so a dashboard
mount pays ~11s per panel and, after a cold start, requests blow past the
client's timeout and the panels render ``—``.

The underlying observations only change on the 3-hour live-refresh cadence (or
at a demo re-hydration on boot), so caching the serialisable results for a few
minutes is safe and turns every dashboard load after the first into sub-second
responses.

Determinism: the cache is bypassed entirely when the backend runs on SQLite
(local dev / pytest), where queries are already fast and test sessions mutate
the same database across tests.
