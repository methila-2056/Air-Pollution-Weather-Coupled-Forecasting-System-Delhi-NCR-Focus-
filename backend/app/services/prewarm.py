"""Cold-start cache pre-warm for the control room.

Render's free tier scales the service to zero after ~15 minutes idle, and a
measured production cold wake takes ~76 s. The Control Room then fans out ~14
requests at once, several of which are heavy aggregations over the pooled Neon
Postgres (``/api/summary`` ~12 s, ``/api/atmosphere/current`` ~11 s for all 17
stations, ``/api/data-quality`` ~11 s). On a cold instance every one of those
caches is empty, so the fan-out serialises on a 0.5-CPU box, individual requests
run past the browser's timeout, and panels are left permanently empty — the
exact failure this module exists to prevent.

Every panel already reads through :func:`..services.ttl_cache.cached`. This
module simply runs the same builders, with the *same cache keys*, in the
background right after the app reports ready. The first dashboard load after a
cold start is then served from a warm cache.

Design notes:

* Opt-in via ``CONTROL_ROOM_PREWARM`` (see :mod:`..config`). It is off by
  default so local development, pytest and CI never pay for it.
* Runs off the event loop in a worker thread, one entry at a time, with a pause
  between entries so a real user request that arrives mid-pre-warm is not
  starved of the single CPU.
* Best-effort: a failing entry is logged and skipped. A pre-warm that throws
  must never take the service down.
* Nothing is fabricated or mutated — these are the same read-only builders the
  HTTP handlers call.

    Two rules, both learned the hard way from a production measurement:

    * **Only keys the client asks for.** The solver is the most expensive read in

      requests is the worst outcome available: it burns the one CPU during the
      cold-boot window and speeds nothing up. An earlier version warmed
      ``dispersion:72:8:all`` while the page had already moved to filtered
      ``frame_hours`` requests, so every entry it created was unreadable garbage.
      Keys now come from :func:`..api.dispersion.dispersion_cache_key`.
    * **Before the cheap reads, not after.** The whole sweep runs in background
      against a single CPU, and the first real user request lands ~76 s after the
      wake. Cheapest-first is the usual instinct, but measured cold-boot timings
      put the three dispersion solves at ~33 s of that window on their own --
      last-in-list they would still have been running when the user's request
      arrived. Dispatch is the one panel a retry cannot rescue (a cold 12 s
