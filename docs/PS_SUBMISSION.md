# SIH 2026 Submission — Smart India Hackathon (SIH26082)

**Problem statement (SIH26082) · Air Pollution–Weather Coupled Forecasting System (Delhi NCR Focus) · MoES / NCMRWF**

> "Develop a coupled air-pollution–weather forecasting system for Delhi NCR that
> supports 72-hour multi-pollutant operational forecasting, incorporating
> weather controls (inversion / PBL / ventilation), regional biomass-burning
> transport, and an actionable air-quality response layer for regulators
> (CPCB-DPCC / CAQM GRAP) — with honest, validated skill."

---

## 1. One-paragraph pitch

AeroCast-NCR ingests real **CPCB** air-quality observations, **NASA FIRMS**
VIIRS fire detections, and **Open-Meteo** full vertical-profile meteorology for
17 Delhi-NCR stations into a weather-coupled machine-learning forecasting
engine. It couples atmospheric physics explicitly: **lapse-rate inversion
scores, PBL-driven ventilation, a PDE dispersion solver, HYSPLIT-aware fire
plume transport**, and a **two-way aerosol–PBL coupling surrogate** flow back
into every forecast. Outputs are delivered as 72-hour per-pollutant forecasts
**with split-conformal prediction intervals**, SHAP explanations,
surge/episode events, **CAQM GRAP**-staged alerts and scenario analysis — all
validated on a chronological test split and deployed as a working product
(Render API + Neon PostgreSQL + Vercel frontend).

---

## 2. Why it matters (impact)

- Delhi NCR sees NAAQS-critical PM2.5 most of Nov–Feb; every regulatory action
  (GRAP Stage I–IV) is triggered by **forecast** AQI, not only observed AQI.
- Regulators need **72-hour lead** to switch construction/fleet/industry stages;
  a decision-support layer that quantifies *fire-plume contribution in µg/m³*
  and flags *inversion onset* is directly actionable.
- Every claim in this submission is backed by validated numbers and live,
  inspectable deployments — no synthetic metrics.

## 5. Real, verified performance (PM2.5, PM25 hourly, chronological test split 2025-08-10 → 2025-12-31, n=15,767/checkpoint)

| Horizon | XGBoost R² | XGBoost MAE | Persistence R² | GRU R² |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| +1h | 0.879 | 26.7 | 0.820 | 0.336 |
| +6h | 0.739 | 40.5 | 0.334 | 0.239 |
| +12h | 0.683 | 44.7 | 0.200 | 0.115 |
| +24h | 0.615 | 49.8 | 0.562 | −0.210 |
| +48h | 0.506 | 57.5 | 0.410 | −0.523 |
| +72h | 0.424 | 62.3 | 0.354 | 0.172 |

**XGBoost and Random Forest beat the persistence baseline at every horizon.**
GRU underperforms — shown honestly on the Model Performance page rather than hidden.

## 6. Cost & performance

| Item | AeroCast-NCR | Typical institutional CTM ops |
|---|---|---|
| Inference (XGBoost/RF, 72h × probes) | < 100 ms / station-on-wake | minutes (WRF-Chem advect+chem) |
| Full 4-model × 6-horizon training | minutes on a laptop CPU; 51 k rows train | hours on HPC clusters |
| Persistent storage | Neon PostgreSQL (free tier, schema-versioned) | dedicated DB + file servers |
| Failure of an upstream feed | graceful degradation + honest status body | usually hard outage |
| Cold-start recovery | Render wakes in under ~90 s, self-hydrates | n/a |

Operational notes: API uses `/api/data-quality` and `/api/system` to show exactly
which upstream is live, archived, or gated — judges can interrogate the truth.

## 7. Sustainability & scale

- **Hand-off ready**: single `docker-compose` backend, Alembic-style migrations,
  idempotent import (station,timestamp keyed), CLI importers for CPCB/FIRMS CSV.
- **Scale**: swap Normalised DB tier; enable `LIVE_REFRESH_ENABLED=true` to make
  refresh a scheduler; drop WRF-Chem `wrfout_d01_*.nc` into `WRF_OUTPUT_DIR` to
  absorb a real CTM surface without code changes.
- **Continuity**: metrics/models stored in DB with schema versions, so new models
  can be A/B-compared against the persisted baselines.

## 8. Five-minute demo script

1. **Login** (analyst@aerocast.in / AeroCast@2026) → header shows Live/Data-stale +
   NCR AQI + station coverage.
2. **Overview dashboard**: station grid, NCR AQI, vertical atmospheric panel,
   **observed vs forecast (7-day verification chart)** with NAAQS 60 line.
3. **72H forecast**: hover the conformal band; open **explainability** — SHAP
   top drivers (fires, inversion, ventilation) for an actual station.
4. **Transport**: FIRMS map → plume risk HIGH with "estimated smoke-attributed
   PM2.5 contribution" (proxy, labelled) → **pollution events** page.
5. **Actions**: Alerts page shows drivers + CAQM GRAP stage mappings; open
   **Architecture & system status** to read engine status (green/indigo/amber)
   and the "what is honest here" panel.
6. **Close**: point at the real metrics table (Section 5) — “every number is from
   a chronological test split, shown live on Model Performance.”

### Lightning numbers for the opening pitch
> "PM2.5 forecasts validated on 15,767 held-out hours: R² 0.88 at 1 h, 0.62 at
> 24 h, 0.42 at 72 h — beating persistence at every horizon — with split-conformal
> uncertainty, SHAP explanations, FIRMS fire-plume attribution in µg/m³, and CAQM
> GRAP-compliant alerts."

## 9. Judge Q&A — honest answers

- **“Where is the real WRF-Chem?”**
  In production reality NCMRWF runs WRF-Chem on HPC. We built the ingestion path:
  provide `WRF_OUTPUT_DIR` with real `wrfout_d01_*.nc` and the surface is absorbed
  and plotted; without it, an analytic dispersion solver powers the plume/risk
  panels. The architecture page shows which state this deployment is in — which is
  the honest engineering answer.
- **“Your coupling is a surrogate — why?”**
  Two-way aerosol–PBL feedback is a validated parametric representation for the
  dashboard layer; a full adjoint CTM coupling belongs on HPC. Our surrogate is
  documented and feature-flagged, and its outputs (inversion, ventilation, plume
  risk) are internally consistent and validated by the ML test split.
- **“How are the numbers real?”**
  Every metric comes from `model_performance` (chronological 2025-08-10→12-31 test
  split, n≈15,767), read live from the API. Nothing in the UI is fabricated; GRU is
  shown honestly as weaker.
- **“Is the data live?”**
  The deployment runs `LIVE_REFRESH_ENABLED=true`; status badge and `/api/system`
  disclose modes. IMD/ERA5 keys return 401 without registration — disclosed, not hidden.
- **“What would you do with real CTM resources?”**
  Replace the surrogate with WRF-Chem output absorption, keep GRAP/alerts/UI
  unchanged — the coupling layer is isolated behind the `system.py` status.
